## FastAPI API Key Dependencies

The following FastAPI dependencies are provided and importable from
`odoo.addons.fastapi_auth_odoo_api_key.dependencies`:

### `def apikey_authenticated_partner_impl() -> Partner`

Return the authenticated partner based on the provided API key. Raise a
401 (unauthorized) if the API key is invalid or the partner could not be
found. Also validates that the user associated with the API key matches
the endpointâ€™s expected user, if specified.

### `def apikey_optionally_authenticated_partner_impl() -> Partner | None`

Return the authenticated partner based on the provided API key, or an
empty recordset if the key is valid but doesn't match the expected user.
Returns `None` if authentication fails silently.

### `def apikey_authenticated_partner_env() -> Environment`

Return an Odoo environment bound to the authenticated partner. The
partner must be authenticated using `apikey_authenticated_partner_impl`.
Raise a 401 if authentication fails.

### `def apikey_authenticated_partner() -> Partner`

Return the authenticated partner bound to the correct Odoo environment.
This function uses the partner returned by
`apikey_authenticated_partner_impl` and binds it to the environment
returned by `apikey_authenticated_partner_env`.

### `def apikey_optionally_authenticated_partner_env() -> Environment`

Return an Odoo environment bound to the optionally authenticated
partner, or a default environment if the partner could not be
authenticated.

### `def optionally_authenticated_partner() -> Partner | None`

Return the optionally authenticated partner bound to the appropriate
environment, or `None` if no valid API key was provided.
